    <h1>What Is Cricket?</h1>
    <p> Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the centre of which
        is a 22-yard pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. </p>

    <h2>My Favourite Players!</h2>
    <b class="net">Babar Azam </b> A right-hand, top-order batsman known for his discipline and level-headed attitude,
    Babar Azam laid claim to a long-term spot in Pakistan's batting line-up with a strong performance in 2016, making
    three consecutive ODI hundreds against West Indies in the UAE, and a 90 in his third Test, in Hamilton. He was 22
    years old at the time.

    Born in Lahore and a first cousin to the Akmal brothers, Azam made his way up through age-group cricket. His journey
    began at an under-15 world championship in 2008 and he played two under-19 World Cups in 2010 and 2012, where he was
    Pakistan's top run-scorer.

    "We didn't have to guide him, he was on his own, but we were supportive all the way," Kamran Akmal said. Azam had
    the distinction of top scoring regularly in age-group domestic cricket before he was called up to the national side
    in 2015 and made his debut during the home ODI series against Zimbabwe - a rarity because Azam's rise was during
    Pakistan's isolation as an international venue due to security concerns.

    His hat-trick of ODI hundreds against West Indies led to a Test debut in the Test series that followed, and Azam had
    to opportunity to cement his spot as the careers of Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq wound down.

    He would grasp that opportunity, and then some. Over the years that followed, Azam became, far and away, Pakistan's
    best batsman, the most famous cricketer in the country, and among the best batsmen in the world. He is, even with so
    much of his career still ahead of him, one of Pakistan's best ever batsmen.

    He was the second fastest player to 2000 ODI runs and the second quickest to 1000 T20I runs. He already has more ODI
    hundreds than all but two Pakistan batsman, and a World Cup hundred in a crunch game against New Zealand will go
    down as one of the great individual Pakistan ODI performances. While the first couple of years of Test cricket
    didn't bring the instantaneous success of white-ball cricket, steady improvements year on year have seen him rank
    among the best Test batsmen since the start of 2018, too.

    Several Pakistan players of this generation have seen regressions after a few years in the side, but Azam,
    mercifully for Pakistan, seems immune to even that malaise. The increased responsibility Pakistan have dumped upon
    his shoulders - he was appointed T20I and ODI captain in 2019 before eventually captaining the Test side since 2021
    - appears to have had little impact on his personal form for now.

    While he doesn't quite have a reputation as one of the deeper thinkers of the game, his captaincy shows embryonic
    signs of modern progressive thinking, and Azam is very much learning on the job. There appears to be no attempt to
    ease any of the pressure placed upon relatively young shoulders, but Azam appears not to be feeling the strain for
    now.<br><br>
    <b class="net">Virat Kohli </b> India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as
    Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that
    was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent
    all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest
    possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.

    This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers especially the
    quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and
    a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way to end up as India's most successful Test captain.

    Barring one in Bangladesh, Kohli scored Test hundreds in and against every country he played. He absolutely smashed
    records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs. He was a genuine threat
    to Sachin Tendulkar's record of 49 ODI and 51 Test hundreds.

    An Under-19 world Cup-winning captain, when he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover
    drive to kill for. He was destined to be India's next big batsman as the Tendulkar era began to retire, but Kohli
    wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the
    intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength
    to do so. He was widely credited for changing the fitness culture in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as
    a criterion for selection.

    Kohli was quite simply India's most powerful captain. Centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also
    happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of
    Indian cricket's biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for
    India, which they did plenty under him.<br><br>
    <b class="net">Zak Crawley </b> Zak Crawley's figures looked unexceptional when he was called-up for England's Test
    tour of New Zealand but, such was his promise and so obvious England's need for resilience at the top of the order,
    his selection at the age of 21 was no surprise.

    Crawley had averaged just 34.16 in the 2019 County Championship season and, in career terms, had only three
    first-class centuries and a first-class average of 31.27. But two of those centuries had come against strong fast
    bowling attacks - a Nottinghamshire side containing James Pattinson and Jake Ball and a Warwickshire attack
    containing Ryan Sidebottom and Henry Brookes - and he had won an array of high-profile admirers. Particularly adept
    against fast bowling, he pulls and cuts well and has developed is white-ball game to the point where he gained a
    place with London Spirit in the first edition of The Hundred.

    He scored just one on his Test debut in New Zealand; a last-minute replacement in Hamilton for the injured Jos
    Buttler. But, having impressed with his character and his excellent fitness, he retained his place for the South
    Africa tour and won another opportunity when Rory Burns suffered another last-minute injury ahead of the Cape Town
    Test. While the eye-catching scores didn't materialise, he improved his Test-best score for five innings in
    succession and registered a maiden half-century in Jo'burg. In that Test, he also put together - with Dom Sibley -
    England's first century opening stand since December 2016 and the first pair of 50+ opening stands in a game since
    2012. An extended run in the side looked certain.

    Crawley became a regular in the Kent side in 2018, playing throughout their promotion-winning season as well as
    figuring in occasional limited overs games. After twice being dismissed in the nineties he scored his maiden
    first-class century in the final home match of the season, making 168 against Glamorgan at Canterbury.

    Crawley would also have claimed his maiden List A century during England's 2017-18 close season in a Kent match
    against the Leeward Islands, during the Regional Super50 tournament at North Sound, only to fail due to what some
    perceived as a combination of ill luck and unsporting behaviour. He was 98 with Kent needing four to win when two
    wides, followed in the next over by a fielder allowing the ball to run to the boundary, left him on a career-best
    99.

    Crawley, a Kent Cricket Academy graduate, signed his first professional contract with Kent at 17 in October 2015. He
    made his List A debut against Essex in the Royal London One-Day Cup in May 2017 before impressing with 62 against
    the touring West Indies during Canterbury Week later that season. He also went to my school! <br><br>
    <b class="net">Steve Smith </b> In a career of twists and turns, Steven Smith started out as a legspinner and become
    Australia's best batter since Sir Donald Bradman, either side of having his career derailed by a ball-tampering
    scandal that saw him stripped of the captaincy and banned for 12 months.

    The rise from that controversy at Newlands in 2018 was near-miraculous: Smith returned to Test cricket with a
    774-run Ashes series in 2019, and pictures of him in tears at Sydney airport after his return in disgrace from South
    Africa were replaced in the popular memory with those of triumphant celebrations of centuries. Part of his
    punishment for Cape Town was being banned from any leadership position for two years, but once he served that
    penance, in late 2021 he was named Pat Cummins' vice-captain and a few weeks later led the side against England when
    Cummins was ruled out of a Test by Covid.

    Smith began his Test career in 2010 as a legspinner who batted at No. 8; by the time he was named Australia's
    captain five years later, he was the No. 1 Test batter in the world and no more than an occasional bowler. His
    talent was apparent early, but as a young batter he had more moving parts than an orchestra - only, they didn't
    always work in harmony. He went away and worked on his game and returned to the Test side two years later with a
    much tighter technique. He still fidgeted between balls but could play every shot in the book, and a few others that
    defied words besides. Quick-footed and adept at facing spin, he is equally comfortable driving and pulling the fast
    bowlers.

    When he was appointed Australia's 45th Test captain, Smith was filling in for the injured Michael Clarke in three
    Tests. That was during a markedly purple patch, even by his standards: he produced six hundreds in eight Tests then,
    against India, West Indies and England. Despite being only 25 at the time, the extra responsibility clearly didn't
    hamper his run-making, and Smith cemented his spot when Clarke retired at the end of the 2015 Ashes in England.

    As Smith's batting developed, his bowling became less frequently sighted, although he could still land the odd
    fizzing legbreak and winkle out a wicket or two. In the field his athleticism and instinct stand out, even in a
    high-quality fielding side like Australia. He has also been a key man in Australia's ODI side, was his country's
    leading run-scorer in their triumphant 2015 World Cup campaign, and became captain in all three formats before his
    career was turned upside down.
